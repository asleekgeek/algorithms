# Algorithms and Data structures

  Algorithms and data structures implemented in C and/or C#

  Instructions to find your way:
  - I tried to separate each data structure and algorithm in separate folders, they resemble the structure of the map below

  ## Fundamental Data Structures
     - Stack (implementation with arrays and linked lists in C / implementation with generic type in C# )
     - Queue (implementation with arrays and linked lists in C / implementation with generic type in C#)
     - Binary Search Tree (basic generic implementation in C#)

  ## Algorithms
     - Array rotation to left and right (implementation in C#)
     - 'Anagram' - Minimum number of character deletions required to make the two strings anagrams. (C#)
     - Hash Tables: Ransom Note (implementation with Dictionary<K, T> in C#)
     - Balanced Brackets (implementation in C# using the custom Stack<T> from above)
     - Queue (implementation with two stacks in C#)
     - Binary Search Tree - check if a binary tree is also a binary serach tree (implemented in C# using Binary Search Tree from above)
     - Prime numbers - basic algorithm for finding prime numbers (implementation in C#)
     - Merge Sort (implementation in C and C# (using List<T>))
