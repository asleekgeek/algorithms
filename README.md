# Algorithms and Data structures

  Algorithms and data structures implemented in C and/or C#

  Instructions to find your way:
  - I tried to separate each data structure and algorithm in separate folders, they resemble the structure of the map below

  ## Fundamental Data Structures
     - Stack (implementation with arrays and linked lists in C)
     - Queue (implementation with arrays and linked lists in C)

  ## Algorithms
     - Array rotation to left and right (implementation in C#)
